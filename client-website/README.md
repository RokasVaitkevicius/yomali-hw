# Example website that uses tracker script

Simplistic html webpage that includes the tracker script

To run this example, I'd use `http-server` node package.

To run it, install `http-server` globally:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Then run it in the `client-website` directory:

```bash
http-server
```
